          <h2>Biography</h2>
          <p class="biography__content">Ludmila Ferber was a pastor, singer and songwriter, born on August 8, 1965 in Rio de Janeiro, a true carioca 'da gema'. She entered the faculty of pedagogy at UFRJ, transferred to letters, but in the end she did not finish; she wanted to make a living from music.</p>
          <p class="biography__content">At age 20, she converted to Christianity in a small group in Niterói, and since then had built her life within the church. His album Marcas, released in 1996, was the beginning of a road that has lasted more than 20 years.</p>
          <p class="biography__content">Her biggest hits include Dreams of God, Breathe the Spirit, Hear God Call Me and Never Stop Fighting—which is also the title of her book, released in 2013 by Thomas Nelson Brasil. During her struggle with lung cancer, she released her first album in 5 years, A New Beginning. She died on the 26th of January, 2022, at the age of 56.</p>
